## Overview

ARWrapper library provided by [ARToolKit](https://github.com/artoolkit/artoolkit5) is compatible with multiple platforms, but not with UWP yet. This project intends to fill this gap. The native library built by this project consumes UWP runtime, and can be accessed by .NET applications via [PInvoke](http://www.pinvoke.net/). 

Starting v0.3, ARToolKitUWP supports HoloLens 2 (ARM64) in addition to HoloLens 1 (x86).

## What's in?

```ARToolKitUWP.sln``` solution builds a dynamic link library for x86 or ARM64, namely, ```ARToolKitUWP.dll```. This library incorporates the following ARToolKit (v5.3.2) components:  
- AR.lib
- AR2.lib
- ARICP.lib
- ARMulti.lib
- ARUtil.lib
- KPM.lib

Therefore, this wrapper is capable of detecting all types of markers supported by ARToolKit: single-pattern, multi-pattern and NFT (Natural Feature Marker).

## Exported APIs
The exported functions from this dll are listed in ```ARToolKitUWP/include/ARToolKitUWP.h```.


## Build
- Make sure you have [Visual Studio 2019](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/install/install-visual-studio) and [Windows 10 SDK](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads/windows-10-sdk) installed.
- Open solution file ```ARToolKitUWP.sln```, choose configuration ```Release, Win32``` or ```Release, ARM64```, and hit ```Build Solution```.
- Find the ```ARToolKitUWP.dll``` file at the output directory. Simple.

## For Unity3D and HoloLens
Place the built library in Unity project folder: ```Assets/ARToolKitUWP/Plugins/WSA/x86/``` or ```Assets/ARToolKitUWP/Plugins/WSA/ARM64/```. In the Unity inspector, these libraries need to be manually set for ```WSAPlayer``` and the correct CPU architecture.
