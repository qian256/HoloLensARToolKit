// File notes:
// Since we use WinRT types in this file, it must be compiled with /ZW compiler option (Visual
// Studio setting "Consume Windows Runtime extension:Yes").
// This will generate linker warning 4264, which can be safely ignored, as we are not exposing any WinRT API
// in the public interface. To do this, add /ignore:4264 to the linker "Additional options" setting.
// See http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/hh771041.aspx for more info.
